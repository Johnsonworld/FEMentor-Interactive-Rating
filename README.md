## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

Feeling pretty comfortable in HTML & CSS, this was my first HTML, CSS & Javascript challenge - so the integration process was a good experience.

I struggle trying to match the colors to the preview images, I think due to my monitor settings.  Next time I'll try upgrading so I can get the Figma files and have more certainty.

CSS custom radio buttons - should have done the star selectors with this but couldn't get them to customize correctly.  I think it was because I started out just using buttons and then tried to convert to radio buttons.  If I did it over I'd start fresh and try to do the custom radio buttons, taking care of that functionality for only allowing one button to be clicked at a time.  Ended up having to do that in JS.

My use of Git/Github getting much more consistent and clean! 

### Continued development

- Need to get much more practice in Javascript fundamentals particularly Get/Set and Document methods.  
- It's not pretty right now - but it works.  Would like to write cleaner and more efficient code.
